    Hello! I'm Joshua. I'm a software developer with a passion for rowing.
    <br />
    I have degrees in Botany, Accounting, and Software Development.
    <br />
    I love OU sports and attend as many games in person as I can. Boomer Sooner!
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm finally spinning up my own portfolio site to showcase some of my personal work.
    <br />
    Check out the Rowing App Demo page to see an app I'm building to track my rowing activities!
